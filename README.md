## What is Floumy?

Floumy is the operating system for self-organizing engineering teams.
It brings OKRs, roadmaps, sprints, feature requests, and issues into one platform, 
powered by AI that gives teams the context to act on their own. Leaders focus on strategy, 
teams align around shared goals, and stakeholders stay in the loop. With the option to build in public, 
organizations reduce overhead, move faster, and earn trust through transparency.

### Core Features
- **OKRs & Roadmaps**: Align your team around clear objectives and key results, and visualize your project roadmaps.
- **Sprints & Task Management**: Plan and manage sprints with ease, track progress, and ensure timely delivery of tasks.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverage AI to gain insights and make informed decisions.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Foster collaboration with built-in communication tools and real-time updates.
- **Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate with popular tools like GitHub and Gitlab.
